## swarm robotics simulation

### Main ideas
 - every queue maintain a list to prevent chain.

### TODO:
 - delete useless calculate and codes
 - use vector instead of scalar
 - multiprocess
 - use javascript as front end

### Usage:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wedge_animation.py ROBOT_NUM # ROBOT_NUM is the number of robots.
```
